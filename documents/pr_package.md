# Frontinus House Ecosystem Council

### What is the Ecosystem Council?

**Overview:**

- Consists of 9 councilors guiding the Ecosystem grant program.
- Aligns the grant program with the DAO’s core values and vision.
- Provides operational support, strategic direction, and oversight to the grant program.

**Expanded Narrative:**

BiblioDAO has evolved over the years, initially starting as a small gaming project to building out a fully-fledged Autonomous World. To realize this ambitious vision, we need to attract an expansive ecosystem of good builders, each operating autonomously and making their own valuable contributions to the world. The Ecosystem Council (EC) is a collection of diverse voices from the Realms community, voted in for a 6-month remit to steward the ecosystem’s expansion. The role of the EC is to provide operational support, strategic direction, and general oversight to the grant mechanism.

### What is the Frontinus House Grant Round?

**Overview:**

- A funding initiative within Realms.World.
- Supports ecosystem growth and development.
- Grants are awarded based on merit and impact.
- Empowers creators with financial resources.
- Voted on by DAO asset holders.
- Held quarterly.

**Expanded Narrative:**

The Frontinus House process is a funding mechanism that utilises DAO assets to attract talented builders and to incentivize building within BibliothecaDAO and its current ecosystem.

### Past Grantees:

Several projects have received grant funding in the past. You can find them all in Frontinus House records. See an example of grant round recipients [here](link).

### Posting BIPs outside grant rounds:

- Community members can propose BIPs anytime.
- Ensures continuous improvement and innovation outside formal grant rounds.
- Allows valuable ideas to be acted upon promptly.

### For a grant recipient, are there expectations around hours worked per week?

There are no rules on this. The DAO reads proposals, asks questions, and then decides how to vote. The best approach is to be upfront about resources and projected timelines in the proposal.

### What is the best way to find others to work on a potential grantee project?

Open a discussion thread in the Realms.World Discord will attract people toward it - in #general or #House-of-Lords - then you will have a location to push people toward.

### Does a project need to integrate Realms.World assets to be eligible for a grant?

You can include some, all, or none of the ecosystem assets. Note that including them gives you an aligned community out of the bag. For example, Realms holders will be particularly interested in projects that include $Lords or Loot Realms NFTs. The Realms ecosystem assets are Loot Realms NFTs, Blobert, Golden Tokens, Beasts, $Lords. Outside of that, there are related NFTs - like the original Loot bag NFTs, Genesis Adventurer NFTs.

### What is the Studio Alignment Framework?

The Studio Alignment Framework manages the studio alignment grant program, providing a clear and consistent foundation for applicants. It assesses applications and manages successful applicants, equipping the DAO with tools for driving successful outcomes without overly restricting applicants.

### What is the general expected amount for a Frontinus House grant?

In the last grant round, 100,000 $LORDS were distributed to each of the five grantees. The larger studio alignment grant is dynamic in scope, and approved proposals have received up to 6,000,000 $LORDS in the past.

### Rules a Frontinus House Grantee Must Follow

When builders apply for a grant within the Frontinus House, they must act to these standards:

- **Understanding:** Builders should ensure they have a complete understanding of the bounty objectives they put forward. They should consider the technical requirements, the desired outcomes, and any constraints specified in the proposal, and if they are achievable.
- **Transparency:** Builders should disclose any potential conflicts of interest and be transparent about their skills, experiences, and resources.
- **Communication:** Builders should communicate effectively. They should be prepared to ask questions to clarify bounty requirements and to respond to questions about their proposals.
- **Quality Assurance:** Builders should outline their approach to quality assurance and testing in their proposals. They should be prepared to explain how they will ensure any protocol component is robust, secure, and reliable.
- **Compliance:** Builders should respect intellectual property rights and other relevant laws and regulations.
- **Feedback:** Builders should be open to receiving and responding to feedback on their proposals and prepared to revise them based on the funding instigator's feedback.

## Realms.World BibliothecaDAO

### What is BibliothecaDAO?

BibliothecaDAO is the custodian of Realms.World, an open-source, permissionless gaming ecosystem and autonomous world built on StarkNet, a Layer 2 Zero-Knowledge rollup. The community formed after the release of the Loot project with its first NFT collection Loot Realms. As a development DAO, the mission is to create on-chain games, welcoming those eager to build games using cutting-edge technologies.

### What is Realms.World?

Realms.World is an eternal, ever-expanding onchain game world developed by BibliothecaDAO. Initially focused on land ownership within the Lootverse, it has evolved into an autonomous, independent world. The DAO’s first self-developed game ‘Realms: Eternum’ launches in Q3 2024.

### What is the Loot connection?

Loot may not be considered an onchain game in the traditional sense, but it has undoubtedly transformed the gaming landscape by introducing the concept of an open and composable world. Loot was the ‘big bang’ that created a new digital universe. Interlinked worlds like Realms, Banners, and Hyperloot are being built in that universe. Other worlds like DOPE DAO and Treasure DAO are being built in parallel universes, those that forked Loot. As demonstrated by the amount of building, Loot was a moment of inspiration for a new generation of developers who are eager to collaborate across the digital realm on a shared mission to build and expand the shared ‘Lootverse’. Loot transcends conventional notions, representing more of an abstract creative idea that permeates culture. The Realms concept has evolved from its initial focus on land ownership within the Lootverse to an autonomous onchain world that operates independently. Every Realm has been procedurally generated and is unique down to the language. Each Realm has a map showing the regions, cities, rivers, and topography that exist in the Realms.World. Resource deposits can be found in each realm with varying rarity and there are 50 Wonders spread among the 8000 Realms.

### What Makes Realms.World an Autonomous World?

An autonomous world must be credibly neutral, free from central control by any group or individual. It is crucial to avoid those who exploit the concept for quick profit. The launch of Eternum is not the end for Realms or Loot; it marks the beginning of ongoing evolution. It is our hope that in 10 years, Eternum will bear little resemblance to the game as it exists today, having grown and transformed over time.

**Key Autonomous World features:**

- **Decentralized Data Availability Layer:** While state execution might occur on a centralized layer, the state must be reconstructible if the execution layer ceases. Rollups solve this by increasing execution capacity while ensuring data permanence on Ethereum, guaranteeing the world’s perpetual persistence.
- **Permissionless Entry Point:** The World contract must accept new systems and components without requiring permission, ensuring open and unrestricted access for enhancements.
